# FlyMambo
## Python wrapper for the Parrot Mambo
- Wrapper over [pyparrot](https://github.com/amymcgovern/pyparrot)
- Single class `FlyMambo` does everything
- Two modes = `NORMAL` (testing) and `SPORT` (aggressive)
- `move_mambo()` to translate and rotate
- `flymambo_example.py` has working example
